# 1. GEE Applications
## (a) GEE app for visualizing LULC and UTFVI (1990-2050)

This is the main app for our project, which shows following rasers as layers, thus providing overlay comparison to see emerging trends over the years. Layers include:
- UTFVI 2050 (Hexagon, aggregated at 100m)
- UTFVI 2050 (Hexagon, aggregated at 250m)
- UTFVI 1990 Winter
- UTFVI 1990 Summer
- UTFVI 2020 Winter
- UTFVI 2020 Summer
- Land use land cover 1990
- Land use land cover 2000
- Land use land cover 2010
- Land use land cover 2020
- Land use land cover Change (1990 to 2020)
- Land use land cover 2050 (Predicted)
